# Changelog

All notable changes are listed here:

## v2.0.4-alpha - 8th Jun 2026

* **LLM**: connect a local OpenAI-compatible server (LM Studio / Ollama, no key) or OpenRouter — base-URL presets, optional key, and a Test &amp; list-models button. Descriptions now feed the model curated, evocative body/star summaries (constraint-grade physics + interesting tags) instead of a raw 40-field physics dump, for more imaginative results.

## v2.0.3-alpha - 8th Jun 2026

* **Companion App**: added "The Guide" skin (friendly illustrated travel companion).
* Fixes: Newton's-apple physics button is green; confirm before File > New Starmap clears the map; Display/Actual time labels no longer clipped under their values; the time transport "..." is now a red warning that confirms the destructive set-now; Traveller mode is its own toggle (not a snap-grid value); the orrery can no longer overflow its cell and occlude the detail drag-bar / push the time pill off-screen; construct location in the report no longer shows 5 decimals.

## v2.0.2-alpha - 8th Jun 2026

* **Companion App (Players' Field Guide)**: new `/catalogue?sid=` live, redacted, in-universe companion to the system you're running. Open it from the system-view rail ("Field Guide..."). Same-machine for now (a mirrored tablet, a second window, your phone on the same browser). Skins: Green Screen / Amber Terminal (lo-fi CRT report), Survey Datapad (clean), Starship Console (live orbital map, tap a world for its file). Launcher has a link + QR. Report rendering extracted into a shared `ReportDocument` so the printed report and the live guide share one document.

  * ***This is the section I am tinkering with mostly - LOTS to add and refine to get from here into the main part of SSE***
* **Physics \& Moon Generation**:

  * Implemented **Satellite Mass Budget Model**: Moon masses are now realistic percentages of parent mass (0.01-0.025% for giants).
  * **Power-Law Distribution**: Satellite systems now favor a single large moon (Titan/Ganymede style) over identical clones.

## v1.10.0 - 1st Apr 2026

* Data Unification \& Editor Features:

  * Unified Star and Planet data structures into a single cohesive `CelestialBody` type, simplifying physics processing and resolving TS errors.
  * High mass planets (Brown Dwarfs) can now be "Ignited" into stars directly within the UI.
  * Low mass stars can be "Doused" back into planets directly within the UI.
  * Added "Rebuild Hierarchy" button to System View. When mass edits fundamentally shift the system's center of mass (e.g. creating a massive star), this button flattens and fully rebuilds the orbital parent-child chains relative to the new heaviest body. It can be destructive so not automated.
* Transit \& Flight Dynamics Improvements:

  * Overhauled post-transit kinematic states to accurately simulate orbital aftermaths during time-scrubbing.
  * Ships arriving in generic orbits (`lo`, `mo`, `ho`) or landed on the surface now correctly lock to their target's global state, eliminating the "glued to the sky" static offset bug.
  * Ships intercepting a construct (rendezvous) now automatically enter `Deep Space` formation flying, matching the station's trajectory instead of continuing inertial drift.
  * Ships arriving at Lagrange points (L1-L5) now mathematically track the parent planet's orbital rotation rather than remaining at a static offset.
* Improved Stability Assessment:

  * Added full system hierarchy scan to catch "Massive Inversions" (orbiting body is heavier than its host) and "Stolen Children" (orbit exceeds host's stable Hill sphere).
  * Added "Consumed/Collided" checks if an orbit drops below the physical radius of its host.
  * Added "Roche Limit Violation" checks for bodies orbiting too close to their host.
  * Rebuild Hierarchy` UI warnings added to the Technical Details panel when mass inversions occur.
* Terminology \& Unit Standardization:

  * Standardized acceleration units to lowercase **"g"** (9.81 m/s²) across tech details, and hazard messages.
* Time Control System Enhancements:

  * Added **"Manual Speed"** mode (speed dial) allowing for persistent integration rates and reversible playback. Works like OLD system.
  * Added **Speed Indicator** (e.g., +1s/s to +10y/s) providing real-time feedback during scrubbing.
  * Increased scrubber precision with a 50% wider slider and unified logic across System and Starmap views.
* Printed Report Improvements (Binary Systems):

  * Implemented hierarchical **stacked rendering** for binary planets in the System Overview diagram.
  * Enclosed binary pairs within a detailed **Barycenter Info Block** in the Celestial Survey for better organization.
  * Added dynamic unit scaling: small orbital distances now automatically switch from **AU** to **km** for readability.
* Precision Orbital Editing:

  * Added "Mean Anomaly" slider and manual numeric entry to all bodies and constructs for fine-tuned positioning.
  * Set all orbital parameters (SMA, Eccentricity, etc.) to use high-precision "any" step for manual entry.
  * Construct editor now supports direct manual entry for Altitude (km) and Orbital Distance (AU).
* Binary Star Orbit Control:

  * Enabled Orbit editing tab for stars within binary systems.
  * Implemented reciprocal coupling: editing one star's position now automatically updates its partner to maintain its stable barycenter.
* Stellar Physics \& Evolution:

  * Implemented **Dual Frost Lines**: distinction between **Formation Frost Line** (170K, historical boundary for gas giant growth) and **Current Frost Line** (125K, modern vacuum ice stability).
  * Added **Spectral-Class Dependent Brightening**: stars now evolve in luminosity based on their type (O/B massive stars brighten rapidly, M-dwarfs remain stable), correctly back-calculating historical formation zones.
  * Fixed **Radiogenic Heating** persistence: manual thermal overrides are now preserved during system processing and correctly account for surface temperature even on rogue/starless bodies.
* Orbital Mechanics \& Generation:

  * Fixed **"0 AU Moon" Bug**: correctly resolved host gravitational parameters for planets orbiting barycenters, ensuring stable moon placements in binary systems.
  * UI refinement for root stellar barycenters: hidden the redundant "Edit" button to prioritize direct name/visibility editing.
* Bug Fixes \& UI Polish:

  * Fixed **Time Epoch Desynchronization** (13.8 billion year jump): ensured all initialization paths correctly offset Big Bang display time into Unix-relative physics time, preventing orbital scrambling on reload.
  * Improved flyby math to correctly calculate zero Delta-V intercepts for unpowered flypasts.
  * Unified "About" dialogs into a single, maintainable component.
  * Easter Egg :)



## v1.9.2 - 24th Mar 2026

* N-Body Gravitational Summation:

  * Transit solvers now sum gravitational forces from all massive bodies (Stars, Planets, Barycenters) for realistic ballistic drift.
  * Replaces single-body Keplerian assumptions with full integrated pathing for all mission types.
* Trajectory Correction Manoeuvres (TCM):

  * Automatic drift tracking injects discrete TCM burn points if n-body perturbations exceed 100km.
  * Compact, color-coded timeline labels and trajectory markers signal manoeuvre intensity (Blue/Orange/Red) based on Max-G.
  * TCMs now correctly consume fuel and contribute to total mission delta-V.
* Planner UI \& Stability:

  * "Transit Tags" summary box added to mission stats for better awareness of aerobraking, TCMs, and high-G status.

  * ensures transfers in multi-star systems use the correct gravitational host,
  * fixes "40 AU loop" bug where binary star transits default to system barycenter.
* Smart Target Redirection:

  * Interplanetary moon transfers now automatically target the parent planet's gravity well while maintaining moon-radius capture.
  * Fixes "dive into the star" bug for local stellar constructs.
* Expanded Lagrange point support (L1-L5):

  * added L1, L2 (radial offsets) and L3 (hidden co-orbital),
  * co-orbital framing ensures L-points are tracked in the host's parent frame.
* Transit intercept accuracy and stability:

  * Fixed "missed intercept" bug: solvers now target actual $(x, y)$ node coordinates at arrival rather than just orbital radius.
  * Stability filter overhaul: removed hard 100km/s cap, increased to 10,000 km/s insanity check to support high-G ship jumps.
  * Forced direct-path (short-way only) for Speed/Direct Burn plans to prevent unrealistic looping arcs.
  * Improved station/construct state resolution: orbiting constructs correctly resolve positions even without explicit orbit objects.
* UI/UX refinements:
