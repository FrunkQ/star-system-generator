# Changelog

All notable changes are listed here:

## v1.10.1 - 12th Jun 2026

* **Versioning note**: this site (the classic V1 interface) returns to its own 1.10.x version line; the in-development V2 carries the 2.x numbers on the beta site.
* **Support debug dump**: press **Ctrl+Alt+Shift+D** anywhere in the app (or run `SSE_DEBUG_DUMP()` in the browser console) to download a diagnostic bundle for support. Files are saved one at a time, rawest data first, so storage contents escape even if the app itself is broken:
  * `SSE-IndexedDB-RAW-<date>.json` — the full raw contents of SSE's browser database (saved starmap), dumped before anything else runs.
  * `SSE-DebugDump-<date>.json` — browser/OS/GPU details, storage quota, service-worker state, captured console errors, and localStorage contents (API keys redacted).
  * `<name>-Starmap-RECOVERED.json` — your starmap in the normal import format, recovered from the live app or, if the app failed to load it, straight from browser storage. Can be re-imported via Upload.
  * `<name>-System-RECOVERED.json` — the system currently on screen, if any.

## v1.10.0 - 1st Apr 2026

* Data Unification \& Editor Features:

  * Unified Star and Planet data structures into a single cohesive `CelestialBody` type, simplifying physics processing and resolving TS errors.
  * High mass planets (Brown Dwarfs) can now be "Ignited" into stars directly within the UI.
  * Low mass stars can be "Doused" back into planets directly within the UI.
  * Added "Rebuild Hierarchy" button to System View. When mass edits fundamentally shift the system's center of mass (e.g. creating a massive star), this button flattens and fully rebuilds the orbital parent-child chains relative to the new heaviest body. It can be destructive so not automated.
* Transit \& Flight Dynamics Improvements:

  * Overhauled post-transit kinematic states to accurately simulate orbital aftermaths during time-scrubbing.
  * Ships arriving in generic orbits (`lo`, `mo`, `ho`) or landed on the surface now correctly lock to their target's global state, eliminating the "glued to the sky" static offset bug.
  * Ships intercepting a construct (rendezvous) now automatically enter `Deep Space` formation flying, matching the station's trajectory instead of continuing inertial drift.
  * Ships arriving at Lagrange points (L1-L5) now mathematically track the parent planet's orbital rotation rather than remaining at a static offset.
* Improved Stability Assessment:

  * Added full system hierarchy scan to catch "Massive Inversions" (orbiting body is heavier than its host) and "Stolen Children" (orbit exceeds host's stable Hill sphere).
  * Added "Consumed/Collided" checks if an orbit drops below the physical radius of its host.
  * Added "Roche Limit Violation" checks for bodies orbiting too close to their host.
  * Rebuild Hierarchy` UI warnings added to the Technical Details panel when mass inversions occur.
* Terminology \& Unit Standardization:

  * Standardized acceleration units to lowercase **"g"** (9.81 m/s²) across tech details, and hazard messages.
* Time Control System Enhancements:

  * Added **"Manual Speed"** mode (speed dial) allowing for persistent integration rates and reversible playback. Works like OLD system.
  * Added **Speed Indicator** (e.g., +1s/s to +10y/s) providing real-time feedback during scrubbing.
  * Increased scrubber precision with a 50% wider slider and unified logic across System and Starmap views.
* Printed Report Improvements (Binary Systems):

  * Implemented hierarchical **stacked rendering** for binary planets in the System Overview diagram.
  * Enclosed binary pairs within a detailed **Barycenter Info Block** in the Celestial Survey for better organization.
  * Added dynamic unit scaling: small orbital distances now automatically switch from **AU** to **km** for readability.
* Precision Orbital Editing:

  * Added "Mean Anomaly" slider and manual numeric entry to all bodies and constructs for fine-tuned positioning.
  * Set all orbital parameters (SMA, Eccentricity, etc.) to use high-precision "any" step for manual entry.
  * Construct editor now supports direct manual entry for Altitude (km) and Orbital Distance (AU).
* Binary Star Orbit Control:

  * Enabled Orbit editing tab for stars within binary systems.
  * Implemented reciprocal coupling: editing one star's position now automatically updates its partner to maintain its stable barycenter.
* Stellar Physics \& Evolution:

  * Implemented **Dual Frost Lines**: distinction between **Formation Frost Line** (170K, historical boundary for gas giant growth) and **Current Frost Line** (125K, modern vacuum ice stability).
  * Added **Spectral-Class Dependent Brightening**: stars now evolve in luminosity based on their type (O/B massive stars brighten rapidly, M-dwarfs remain stable), correctly back-calculating historical formation zones.
  * Fixed **Radiogenic Heating** persistence: manual thermal overrides are now preserved during system processing and correctly account for surface temperature even on rogue/starless bodies.
* Orbital Mechanics \& Generation:

  * Fixed **"0 AU Moon" Bug**: correctly resolved host gravitational parameters for planets orbiting barycenters, ensuring stable moon placements in binary systems.
  * UI refinement for root stellar barycenters: hidden the redundant "Edit" button to prioritize direct name/visibility editing.
* Bug Fixes \& UI Polish:

  * Fixed **Time Epoch Desynchronization** (13.8 billion year jump): ensured all initialization paths correctly offset Big Bang display time into Unix-relative physics time, preventing orbital scrambling on reload.
  * Improved flyby math to correctly calculate zero Delta-V intercepts for unpowered flypasts.
  * Unified "About" dialogs into a single, maintainable component.
  * Easter Egg :)



## v1.9.2 - 24th Mar 2026

* N-Body Gravitational Summation:

  * Transit solvers now sum gravitational forces from all massive bodies (Stars, Planets, Barycenters) for realistic ballistic drift.
  * Replaces single-body Keplerian assumptions with full integrated pathing for all mission types.
* Trajectory Correction Manoeuvres (TCM):

  * Automatic drift tracking injects discrete TCM burn points if n-body perturbations exceed 100km.
  * Compact, color-coded timeline labels and trajectory markers signal manoeuvre intensity (Blue/Orange/Red) based on Max-G.
  * TCMs now correctly consume fuel and contribute to total mission delta-V.
* Planner UI \& Stability:

  * "Transit Tags" summary box added to mission stats for better awareness of aerobraking, TCMs, and high-G status.
  * Direct Burn profile state (Accel/Coast/Brake) is now persistent and decoupled from ballistic plan states.

  * Bypassed Lambert solver artifacts for high-thrust "Direct Burn" plans.
  * Eliminates "2000c" speed-of-light errors in favour of robust kinematic straight-line profiling.
* Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA) frame selection for transits:

  * ensures transfers in multi-star systems use the correct gravitational host,
  * fixes "40 AU loop" bug where binary star transits default to system barycenter.
* Smart Target Redirection:

  * Interplanetary moon transfers now automatically target the parent planet's gravity well while maintaining moon-radius capture.
  * Fixes "dive into the star" bug for local stellar constructs.
* Expanded Lagrange point support (L1-L5):

  * added L1, L2 (radial offsets) and L3 (hidden co-orbital),
  * co-orbital framing ensures L-points are tracked in the host's parent frame.
* Transit intercept accuracy and stability:

  * Fixed "missed intercept" bug: solvers now target actual $(x, y)$ node coordinates at arrival rather than just orbital radius.
  * Stability filter overhaul: removed hard 100km/s cap, increased to 10,000 km/s insanity check to support high-G ship jumps.
  * Forced direct-path (short-way only) for Speed/Direct Burn plans to prevent unrealistic looping arcs.
  * Improved station/construct state resolution: orbiting constructs correctly resolve positions even without explicit orbit objects.
* UI/UX refinements:

  * New "Major Target -> Sub-Target" dropdown workflow in Transit Planner.
  * Improved hidden-plan reason messages in the UI.
  * Added internal transit debug logging to developer console.
