# Gemini Development Log

## Current State
- **Last Change:** Implemented barycenter generation for multi-star systems. This included refactoring `api.ts` to handle `starCount > 1` and adding UI controls to `+page.svelte` to select the number of stars.
- **Next Step:** Awaiting user feedback on the multi-star implementation.
