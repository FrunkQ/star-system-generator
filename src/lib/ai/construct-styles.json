    "guideline": "Write as a weary, greasy ship's mechanic. The tone is informal, frustrated, and practical. Uses sentence fragments and slang. Focuses on **what's broken, the lack of spare parts, and the 'personality' of the machine** (e.g., 'She's kicking like a mule,' 'filters clogged again')."

  {
    "label": "Ship Spotter's Blog",

  },
  {
    "label": "Tech-Cultist's Scripture",
